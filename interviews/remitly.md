# Remitly



## Behavioral
- How do you handle conflict brought on by working with people from different cultures?

Working at immigrate.ai my team was made up of people from all different cultures, pakistani, iranian, indian. With everyone being from different backgrounds and cultures, everyone has a different working within a team, that don't align with our expectations. Some are more direct, some are more passive, this can lead to challenges to conflict resolution that is outside the actual problem. What I found worked for us is that we built relationships with eachother that helped us become more comfortable with conflict. This was done by asking questions about eachothers culture, sharing stories, sharing food and with this strong foundation we were able to work cohesivley as a team.


- How do you communicate that a project is taking longer than planned and what solutions do you offer?

Working at Immigrate.ai, since it was a startup there were a lot of times we've dealt with ambiguity in requirements where the full scope of a project was not stated. So a lot of the time we were building with change in mind, but we would run into expected challenges as we were working with new technolgies so we had to allocate time for exploration as well. With these unknown variables there were times when our initial estimate would take longer than expected. First thing is to inform earlier than later, to let your team/stakeholders know the issues and gain some guidance. Second let them know what we have tried, what is the core problem and why they arent working. Finally letting them know what you are currently working on to solve the problem + ask any questions/ask for guidance. One key thing is to show ownership over the problem and not place blame on any 1 member.
